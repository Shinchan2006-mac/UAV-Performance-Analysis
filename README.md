MATLAB analysis for a Cropped Delta Wing UAV
# UAV Trim, Thrust, and Power Analysis
A computational study of a Cropped Delta Wing UAV using MATLAB to evaluate flight performance and trim conditions.

## 1. Problem Description
The objective of this project is to analyze the trim condition, thrust required, and power required for a cropped delta wing UAV in steady level flight. We evaluate how flight velocity and performance metrics vary with the angle of attack ($\alpha$) ranging from $0^\circ$ to $12^\circ$.

## 2. Geometry & Aerodynamics
* *Configuration:* Cropped delta wing (wing-alone).
* *Root chord ($C_r$):* 0.9 m.
* *Tip chord ($C_t$):* 0.15 m.
* *Span ($b$):* 1.5 m.
* *Mass:* 3.5 kg.

## 3. Key Performance Trends
The analysis provides 8 key visualizations required for the project:
1. Trim angle of attack vs Velocity.
2. Trim elevator deflection vs Velocity.
3. Lift coefficient ($C_L$) vs Velocity.
4. Drag coefficient ($C_D$) vs Velocity.
5. Thrust required ($T_r$) vs Velocity.
6. Power required ($P_r$) vs Velocity.
7. $C_L/C_D$ (Aerodynamic Efficiency).
8. $C_L^{3/2}/C_D$ (Endurance Metric).
